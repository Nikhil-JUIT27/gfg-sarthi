# Privacy Policy for GFG Sarthi

**Last Updated:** October 19, 2025

Thank you for using GFG Sarthi ("the extension"). This policy explains what information is used and how.

## No Data Collection
This extension is built with user privacy as a priority.

* **We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.**
* The extension analyzes the code you type *locally* in your browser to provide local variable suggestions. This code never leaves your computer.
* To provide "Smart Suggestions," the extension sends only the current prefix you are typing (e.g., "vect") to a backend server. Your full code, user ID, or any other personal information is **never** sent.

## Permissions
The extension requires the `activeTab` and `scripting` permissions to interact with the GeeksforGeeks problem page editor. This is solely to inject the autocomplete functionality and is not used for any other purpose.

## Contact
If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please open an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Nikhil-JUIT27/gfg-sarthi/issues).
